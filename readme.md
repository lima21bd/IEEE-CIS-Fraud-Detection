### IEEE-CIS-Fraud-Detection

> Upskill ISA (Income Sharing Agreement) collaborated with Intelligent Machines offering a "Machine Learning Course" where only 39 shortlisted candidates are provided with the opportunity to take this course for free. This project is completed by me uploaded in this repository.

*This project is inspired from IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Kaggle competition. This competition introduces a binary classification problem. The target variable is a binary attribute and this task aims to classify users into "fraud" or "not fraud" as well as possible.*
